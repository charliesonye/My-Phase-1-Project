# My-Phase-1-Project

**Introduction**

There has been a recent change in how and more importantly, where professionals work. This project aims to serve these remote-workers that have the flexibility to choose where they would like to live and work. 

When the application is fully functional, users will be able to see a list of 5 of the best locations for digitial nomads. Users will be able to view these locations and choose their favorite of the 5, which will influence the order of the list over time based on the amount of likes a location receives. 



First we host our page on GitHub
